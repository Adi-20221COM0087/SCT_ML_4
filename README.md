Task 04 – Hand Gesture Recognition Using Computer Vision

This project focuses on developing a hand gesture recognition model that can identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, aiming to support gesture-based human-computer interaction systems. The model was built using the Hand Gesture Dataset
, applying computer vision and deep learning techniques to process and interpret hand gestures.
While the core functionality for static image classification has been implemented, the following task requirements are partially or not fully met:

⚠ Accuracy Check – Partial: The model achieves moderate accuracy but can be improved with more data and tuning.

⚠ Gesture-based Interaction – Partial: Some gesture-based interaction logic has been explored, but it's not fully functional.

❌ Video / Real-time Input – Missing: Real-time gesture detection from webcam/video stream has not been implemented.

Even though some parts of the task are incomplete, this project shows a clear understanding of the basics of hand gesture recognition and can be improved further by adding real-time input and increasing model accuracy.
